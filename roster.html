            <strong>Roles: AWPer · Team Mentor</strong>
            <p>HLTV Rating: 1.07</p>
            <p>Laccitiello is the last original founder on the active GUMPGANG roster. Signing with the team in the
                beginning, of May of 2020, he came up as an dominant onliner. Although there is a recent decline in
                performance on Laccitiello's part, and a strong inability to clutch, he continues to stay on the roster
                for some apparent reason. He is known for an infamous 1v5 P-90 Clutch.</p>

            <p>Joining the active GUMPGANG roster in early 2021, Specht had a slow start but has gradually improved over
                time to be the most consistent and highest-fragging member of the current lineup. He is famous for his

            <p>HLTV Rating: 0.23</p>
            <p>CO2 was an original founder who signed onto GUMPGANG in May of 2020. Right off the bat there was an
                obvious skill gap between him and the rest of the roster, but as time went on he improved. He is now a
                veteran/stand-in for the team. From September 2021 - February 2022 his contract was terminated, but he
                has been on the bench as a trial player recently.</p>
